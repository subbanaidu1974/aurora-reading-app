# Aurora Angular 20 (scaffold)

This is a minimal Angular project scaffold (targeting Angular 20 as requested) that includes the AuroraLanding component and two dummy pages (About, Login).

## How to run

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Serve the app:
```bash
npm start
# or
ng serve
```

3. Open http://localhost:4200 in your browser.

> Note: Angular 20 is experimental in this scaffold — if you get dependency resolution issues, change versions in package.json to a stable Angular version you have installed (e.g., 16 or 17), then run `npm install` again.
